\textbf{Parameters:}\\
I : Set of products\\
$I^{1}$: Set of product pairs (i1, i2) that cannot be placed on the same shelf.\\
$I^{2}$: Set of product pairs (i1, i2) that will be included together in the assortment.\\
K : Set of shelves\\
$\pi_i$: Profit made by selling one unit of product i\\
$w_k$ : Width of shelf k\\
$\gamma_k$ : Shelf k’s effect on demand\\
$ds_k$ : Depth of shelf k\\
$dp_i$ : Depth of unit product i\\
$b_i$: Width of a facing for product i\\
$d_i$: Coefficient for demand rate for product i per unit width and one facing\\
$\beta_i$: Space elasticity factor for product i\\
$s^{l}_i$ : Lower bound on the shelf inventory of product, if i is selected in the assortment\\
$s^{u}_i$ : Upper bound on the shelf inventory of product, if i is selected in the assortment\\
\\
\textbf{Calculated Data Sets:}\\
$N_{ik}$: number of product i in shelf k per allocation:\\
$N_{ik}=(ds_k/dp_i)-((ds_k/dp_i)\%1)$\\
\\
\textbf{Decision Variables:}\\
$X_{ik}:$ Will the product i be on shelf k\\
$f_{ik}$: number of allocated facings for product i on shelf k.\\
\\
\textbf{Objective function:}\\
max $\sum^{productCount}_{i=1}\sum^{shelfCount}_{k=1}\pi_i \gamma_k d_i(f_{ik} * b_i)^{\beta_i}$\\
\\
\textbf{Subjected To:}\\
$\sum^{shelfCount}_{k=1}X_{ik}\leq 1$ (comes from Rule 1)\\
\\
$f_{ik}\leq4$ for all i and k.   (comes from Rule 2)\\
\\
$\sum^{shelfCount}_{k=1}f_{ik}*N_{ik}\leq s^{u}_i*X_{ik}$ \\
\\
$\sum^{shelfCount}_{k=1}f_{ik}*N_{ik}\geq s^{l}_i*X_{ik}$\\
(above 2 constrains comes from Rule 3 and 4)\\
(above 2 constrains also enforces $f_{ik}$ to be 0 when $X_{ik}$ is 0)\\
\\
$\sum^{productCount}_{i=1}f_{ik}*b_i\leq w_k$ for all k (comes from 6)\\
\\
$X_{2,k}+X_{5,k}\leq 1$ for all k (comes from Rule 7)\\
$X_{3,k}+X_{8,k}\leq 1$ for all k (comes from Rule 7)\\
$X_{16,k}+X_{20,k}\leq 1$ for all k (comes from Rule 7)\\
$X_{1,k}-X_{12,k}=0$ for all k (comes from Rule 8)\\
$X_{3,k}-X_{8,k}=0$ for all k (comes from Rule 8)\\
$X_{9,k}-X_{15,k}=0$ for all k (comes from Rule 8)\\
$X_{16,k}-X_{20,k}=0$ for all k (comes from Rule 8)\\
