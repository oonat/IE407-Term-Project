In this section, we analysed how the solution and profit given in \ref{q2} change, if the shortest (in width) available shelf is allocated to some other category. The shortest shelf in \ref{data-set} is the one with Shelf number 1. Since the shelves are allocated for only the products belong to the same category, by allocating it to some other category, in fact we remove it from our data set.
