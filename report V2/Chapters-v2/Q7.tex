In this section, we analysed how the solution found in \ref{q2} changes when the restriction requiring Product 3 and Product 8 to be placed on different shelves is removed and the restriction requiring these two products to be assorted together and placed to the same shelf is added.

As a result of this change in constraints, we should see a change in profits, if at least one of them exists in the previous solution. But this may not always happen. In the case of the products are never put in the shelves, we should see profit isn't changed. Otherwise, we still cannot say that this will change profit positively or negatively. The reason is we are removing one constraint, and adding a new constraint.
