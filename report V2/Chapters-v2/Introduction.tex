In this project, we have developed a solution for "Assortment Selection and Shelf Space Allocation Problem". Although in the literature, the problem has different variations, we studied a simplified version of the problem where,
\begin{itemize}
	\item If a product is chosen for the assortment, then all the facings of the product have to be filled fully. This restriction is especially important since dealing with variable size allocations makes the problem more complex. Such situation can be found in \cite{hubner}
	\item The manager does not want to allocate more than four facings for a product. The importance of this constraint is explained in \ref{p_body}
	\item Other constraints can be found in \ref{rules}
\end{itemize}
