By modelling the problem and using OpenSolver, we have found that under these circumstances the most important features of our model, and the ones that will add the most profit in case of addition, are space elasticity factors, shelves' effect on demand, coefficient for demand rate, and product profit per unit. We also want to note that since shelf effect on demand multiplies all the products on it, it is the best feature if we can only afford to increase one feature. We see that by changing the numbers in our model in OpenSolver, but we also see that in our objective function. All of the things are unique to a product, and one of them unique for every situation of products, except shelf effect on demand.
