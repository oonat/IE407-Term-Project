To summarize, in this project, we tried to solve Assortment Selection and Shelf Space Allocation Problem. We have designed a mathematical model that fits given constraints and achieved to obtain optimized objective function values and corresponding decision variables. As a result of our analysis on the dataset given in \ref{data-set}, we have found the objective function value as \textbf{6945.73351921896}. Furthermore, we got the highest profit of \textbf{7165.30316863258} among the given scenarios when we added a new shelf (\ref{q4_reference}). In this scenario, we have achieved \textbf{+219.569649414} profit increase. \\

In conclusion, the employees should place the most profitable products on shelves with the highest shelf effect on demand. When adding a shelf that has shelf effect on-demand value($\gamma_k$) of let us say A, the employees should move some of the most profitable products from shelves that has lower shelf effect on-demand value($\gamma_k$) then A to the new shelf. Also, when removing a shelf, we should consider moving the most profitable products on that shelf to other shelves even if the shelf we are removing has the lowest shelf effect on-demand value($\gamma_k$). Lastly, if a product is going to be assorted the employees should choose how many of facings a product will have based on its $\beta_i$ value(for the most part) and other coefficients($\pi_i,b_i,d_i$).
