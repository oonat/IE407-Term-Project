In conclusion, the employees should place the most profitable products on shelves that has highest shelf effect on demand. When adding a shelf that has shelf effect on demand value($\gamma_k$) of lets say A, the employees should move some of the most profitable products from shelves that has lower shelf effect on demand value($\gamma_k$) then A to the new shelf. Also when removing a shelf we should consider to move the most profitable products on that shelf to other shelves even if the shelf we are removing has the lowest shelf effect on demand value($\gamma_k$). Lastly if a product is going to be assorted the employees should choose how many of facings a product will have based on its $\beta_i$ value(for most part) and other coefficients($\pi_i,b_i,d_i$).
