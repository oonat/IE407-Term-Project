In this section, solution of the problem for given data set \ref{data-set} obtained by using the given model and our observations about the results can be found.
\\
We used below formulas to simplify our calculations:\\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
1-f(i,k)^{\beta_i}=\sum_{j=1}^{4}X_{ijk}*j^{\beta_i} \quad \forall i\in I \quad \forall k\in K\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2-f(i,k)=\sum_{j=1}^{4}X_{ijk}*j \quad \forall i\in I \quad \forall k\in K\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
3-Z(i,k)=\sum_{j=1}^{4}X_{ijk} \quad \forall i\in I \quad \forall k\in K\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\\
\textbf{Important Notes:} 1st formula is used in objective function.\\
2nd and 3rd formulas are used repeteadly on constraints.\\
1st formula was selected like that to make our model lineer.\\
\\
Objective function result was found as: \textbf{6838,349047}\\

According to results from opensolver:\\
178,9355445 from products in shelf 1 which has $\gamma_k$ of 0.25 and width of 50cm\\
1105,538071 from products in shelf 2 which has $\gamma_k$ of 0.6 and width of 65cm\\
3508,467561 from products in shelf 3 which has $\gamma_k$ of 1 and width of 80cm\\
1800,355036 from products in shelf 4 which has $\gamma_k$ of 0.6 and width of 95cm\\
345,0528341 from products in shelf 5 which has $\gamma_k$ of 0.25 and width of 110cm\\
\\
3rd shelf that has the highest $\gamma_k$ value gained most money.\\
Also we gained more from shelf 4 in comparison to shelf 2 and\\
5 in comparison to shelf 1 even though they had the same $\gamma_k$.\\
The reason of this is the difference in their width.\\
Shelves 4 and 5 had also more space for more products and facings.\\
Because of that those shelves gained more money even though they had the same $\gamma_k$.\\
